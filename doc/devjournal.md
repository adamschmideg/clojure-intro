# Which terminal cast site to use?

I tried shelr.tv first, because you can change its playback speed.  But
I coulnd't log in either with my github, or my twitter account.  So I
couldn't generate an API token which is needed to upload a recording.
There were some problems with sound recording using Sox on OSX, but
that's not crucial.

Then I tried asciinema.org.  I don't like that it uses its own recorder
and format.

I tried playterm.org at last.  It uses plain old `ttyrec` which is good,
but it doesn't handle colors, only black-and-white.  It doesn't handle
backspace, but leaves weird characters instead.  No reference to its
source.  No good at all, out of question.
